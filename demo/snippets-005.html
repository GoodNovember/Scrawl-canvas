    data-description="Satellite images show the scale of the damage caused by the 2020 explosions in the Lebanese capital, with buildings miles from the port lying in ruin. Points of interest include: 1, center-left (before) a very large shed on the dockside surrounded by lorries and containers; 2, center-right (after) a similar shed, completely destroyed; 3, bottom-center (both images) a boat in the harbour afloat (before) and rolled on its side (after); 4, top-right (before) some large transport containers, missing in the after image; 5, centre (both images) a roundabout connecting the sheds to the transport network.

    <!--
      The container contains two <div> elements, one for each panel of the infographic. Each element includes an <img> element and however many <p> elements are required to add hotspot information points (which trigger when hovered over or tapped) to that panel. 

      The <div> elements need an id value, alongside a data-frame attribute set to either "left" or "right", so we can position the panels correctly
    -->
    <div 
      id="beirut-infographic-before"
      data-frame="left">

      <!--
        Give each <img> element an id value alongside some alt text and a src url

        src="img/beirut-2020-before.webp" />
      <!--
        Each <p> element needs an id value together with some data- attributes

          - data-type="pin" - for proof of concept we're only handling spot pins, not area pins

          - data-position - a string of two percentage values, separated by a comma - these are the x and y coordinates of where the pin will appear over the image

          - data-justify - where we want the text to appear relative to the pin's location - acceptable values are "left", "right", "above", "below"

          - data-shared - if included, we create pins on both panels (so it never disappears when the slider moves across it)

        The text in the <p> element is the text that will be used for the pin's label. Note that the snippet has been set up to interpret and display the following inline markup: <b></b>, <strong></strong>, <i></i>, <em></em>

          - Additional, span-mediated markup is also supported: <span class="sc-red"></span>, etc.

          - If initial word markup doesn't show correctly in the label, place a non-breaking space at the start of the text

    <h4>Test purpose</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial code is friendly to non-Javascript users</li>
      <li>Import the before-after-slider-infographic.js snippet code</li>
      <li>Apply the snippet to our markup. Make sure that the code:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Creates a &lt;canvas> element</li>
        <li>Parses the supplied element's children, extracting data, and then deletes those children from the DOM</li>
        <li>Loads the images into the correct panels</li>
        <li>Creates all required pins and positions them correctly on the canvas</li>
        <li>Styles the pins in accordance with their data-attribute values</li>
        <li>Creates the slider functionality</li>
        <li>Displays pin labels when user hovers over pins</li>
        <li>Formats the pin label text correctly</li>
        <li>Adds the linked entitys to the canvas</li>
        <li>Underlines links when user hovers over them</li>
        <li>Opens the correct web page when user clicks on the link</li>
        <li>Allows user to tab through links, and open links using enter,shift+enter, etc key presses</li>
        <li>Adjustsd text sizes of labels and links when user resizes browser window</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Known issue:</b> this demo is extremely slow in Firefox, to the point of unusability. Seerms there may be a connection to loading modules, or or over-manipulating the DOM? While other snippet demos don't run particularly slow on Firefox, demo Module-001 (Hackney crimes graphics) is also very slow to respond to mouse interactions.</p>
